# Why use a portfolio optimizer?
Are you:
- Testing 20+ live models but don't know how to best allocate your NMR stakes?
- Suffered from BIG burn in 1-2 over-staked models, while all the other models were doing fine?
- Not sure what Numerai corr/ True Contribution metric multiplier (0,1x,2x) to pick for your models?

**Portfolio Optimizer is here to help!**

Portfolio Optimization originates from Harry Markowitz's Model Portfolio Theory (1952). The objective is to find the **optimal weights of a set of assets (Numerai models)** to: 
1. **Maximize the risk-adjusted return** (Sharpe ratio) 
    - Higher Sharpe ratio => better model (return is yummyðŸ˜‹)
2. **Minimize the volatility** (standard deviation)
    - Lower standard deviation => better model (burn is painful...)

# How does it work?
- Step 1: Extract model performance metrics (Numerai Correlation / True Contribution) using Numerai API (or compute model performance from validation set)
- Step 2: Use the optimizer to find the optimal weights of the models
- Step 3: Review and select your optimal portfolio mix for model staking

# Status - Work in progress
- Currently only support portfolio mix with fixed **1x** Correlation Multiplier
- WIP: add support for variable Correlation Multiplier (corr + TC with different multiplier)
