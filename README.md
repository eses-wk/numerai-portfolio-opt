# Why use a Portfolio Optimizer?
Are you:
- Regularly submitting 20+ live models but don't know how to best allocate your NMR stakes?ðŸ¤”
- Don't know metric multiplier (0.5x, 1x, 2x) to pick for your models to maximize risk-adjusted return? 
- Suffered from BIG burn in 1-2 over-staked models, while all the other models were doing fine?ðŸ”¥
- Suffered from prolonged burn in bad market regime, want to control your overall drawdown, minimize your risks?


**Portfolio Optimizer is here to help!**

Portfolio Optimization originates from Harry Markowitz's Model Portfolio Theory (1952). The core idea is to find a balance between the risk-return tradeoff, through constructing an efficient set of portfolios - **Efficient Frontier**. The concept is widely used in the financial industry, and it is also applicable to Numerai model staking. It takes into account the **correlation between models**, and **historical return**, to find the optimal weights of the models to build your portfolio.

Common types of portfolios:
1. **Maximize the risk-adjusted return** (Max Sharpe ratio=> mean return / standard deviation) 
    - Higher Sharpe ratio => better model (return is yummyðŸ˜‹)
2. **Minimize the volatility** (Min standard deviation)
    - Lower standard deviation => better model (burn is painful...)

# How does it work?
- Step 1: Extract model performance metrics (Numerai Corr / True Contribution) using Numerai API (or compute model performance from validation set)
- Step 2: Use the optimizer to find the optimal weights of the models
- Step 3: Review and select your optimal portfolio mix for model staking

# Development Status
- [x] Support portfolio optimization for live models
- [x] Support simulating different allocation of metrics multiplier (Numerai Correlation: 0.5x, 1x | True Contribution: 0x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x)
- [ ] Support portfolio optimization for on validation set
- [ ] Add flexibility for portfolio constraints (return vs. risk tradeoff)
